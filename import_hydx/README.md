# Plugin to import GWSW Hydx files into a 3Di model.

This plugin converts a GWSW Hydx dataset into a 3Di model. To use it you select a Hydx dataset and a destination database (sqlite or Postgresql). The importer supports all Hydx options except for some less frequent profiles like "muil" and "heul".

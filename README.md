Beta plugins for use of 3Di in the modeler interface

These are Plugins developed for QGIS to aid in the modelling with 3Di. They are tested on QGIS 3.4.5. Most likely the plugins will function on newer QGIS versions as well, but this is not tested. The plugins are not compatible with QGIS 2 versions. 

To use the plugin you can download the zip:
https://github.com/threedi/beta-plugins/archive/master.zip

Extract the zip file and paste the folder in:
C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins

Afterwards you should open QGIS, go to plugin manager, installed plugins, and activate the new plugins.

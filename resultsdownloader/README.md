# Resultsdownloader

Plugin which searches the 3Di results database based on scenario name. Once a scenario is selected all available rasters are returned. These can either be visualized directly in the QGIS interface (as WMS) or downloaded as a TIF file. 

Please note: the search for scenarios starts once typing in the filter window is finished. Therefore it might look like the search does not start, while it does. Also: the download can take a quite long time. This is because the files are not stored in a TIF format and have to be converted first.

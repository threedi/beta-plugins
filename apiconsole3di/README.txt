Plugin to easily start a headless 3Di calculation through the API  

To start a headless 3Di calculation one can use the 3Di API. However, as it is fairly complicated to communicate through the API we created a plugin which compiles the API call for you. The plugin provides an easy form to start your 3Di calculation.

In the form you enter your model slug, scenario and required processed results. Then you simply start the simulation and receive an email once your results are there.
